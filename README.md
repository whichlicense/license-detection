# WhichLicense detection

This is a library to facilitate the detection of licenses in source code.

## Usage

### Multi-threaded detection

The multi-threaded detection works by spawning a number of scheduling threads
which subsequently spawns a number of detection threads. The scheduling threads
are responsible for splitting the license database into sections and handing
them off to the detection threads. The detection threads are responsible for
detecting the licenses in the given section of the license database.

Most operating systems will spread the scheduling threads across the available
cores whilst the detection threads will be spread across the available threads.

```typescript
const ds = new DetectionScheduler();
const detected = await ds.detectLicense(SOME_LICENSE);
```

> Note: once an instance of the detection scheduler has been created, it should
> be reused for all subsequent detections. The detection scheduler will spawn
> the scheduling and detection threads once and reuse them for all subsequent
> detections.

### Single-threaded detection

```typescript
detectLicense(SOME_LICENSE);
```
